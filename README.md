# Device Info Bookmarklet

## a portable utility for better digital communication 

Hi my name is Cullan and I have created a small bookmarklet/web utility in an attempt to help communication between QA, Devs, Project Managers and Clients. I work at a digital agency here in Minneapolis Minnesota. Our project flow is most likely just like yours. At the end of our development cycle an internal QA followed by client UAT is commenced. The idea here is that each ticket is logged with a device data stamp when tickets are created. This small piece of data can save one or many emails back and forth between individuals. If this tool saves even one email conversation than my job here is done.

## Tip

If your have many testing devices I recommend having a single user on as many devices as possible. Example if you have an apple id shared between your ipad/iphone/laptop. When adding this bookmarklet to one device it will automatically be created on all devices.
